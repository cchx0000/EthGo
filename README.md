# EthGo

## Inspiration
An exploding number of smart contracts are being deployed, "Google for smart contract" will become very necessary. 

## Features
(1)	Fully decentralized

(2)	Owner control

(3)	Accessible/Open

## What it does
(1)	Provides a standard framework for smart contract keyword tagging/untagging in a decentralized and inexpensive way 

(2)	Provides an interface to allow users to search for smart contracts based on keywords.

(3)	Provides an interface for smart contract owners to tag/untag keywords

## What's next for EthGo
(1) Compatibility/support for existing contracts

(2) Allow for individual contract description

(3) True decentralization with IPFS
